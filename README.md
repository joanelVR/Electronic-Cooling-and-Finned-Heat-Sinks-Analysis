# Electronic-Cooling-and-Finned-Heat-Sinks-Analysis
##### With an increase in heat dissipation from microelectronic devices and the reduction of overall heat, thermal management becomes more important to the different components of electronic devices. The design of a heat sinks needs to be based upon a complete approach to derive the most satisfactory results possible. Heat sinks are widely used as a mean of heat transfer from a component to an environmental air. A critical decision of the design process of cooling was to figure out which method of cooling would successfully cool down the chip. This decision is based on a function of the surface heat flux and the difference between the ambient and surface temperatures. The surface temperature exposed to a chip is substantial when these are operating to their fullest potential. The following are the designes constraints/considerations that were outlined for this project.
  * Number of fins should not exceed 30, considering difficulties in fabrication of heat sinks (Less fins are key essential)
  * The desired heat sink total resistance must be less than the maximum allowable thermal resistance (R_total≤R_maximum )
	* The allowable volumetric flow rate has to be more than the minimum volumetric flow rate (G≫G_minimum)
	* Height of heat sink must not exceed 50 mm
